## NOTE

Since dependabot bot doesnt support lerna packages yet, so we cant make this as a lerna package.

You can track the issue raised [here](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/2167).

Earlier this was a lerna package but was reverted since it was causing the aforementioned problem. It was reverted in this [Pull Request](https://github.com/amitsingh-007/bypass-links/pull/624).
